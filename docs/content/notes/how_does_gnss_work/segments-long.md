## GPS segments

The GPS system consists of three segments:

1. The **space segment**, consisting of 24 or more satellites, with accurate atomic clocks on board, continuously transmitting ranging signals to Earth.
2. The **control segment**, consisting of a number of ground stations, which monitors the satellites, computes their orbits and clock offsets, and uploads this information to the satellites, which in turn encode this information on the ranging signal (the so-­called navigation data).
3. The **user segment**, simply consisting of many GPS receivers, which each track four or
more GPS satellites, and compute their own position.

GNSS orbital planes are **inclined** with respect to the equator (at 55° for GPS). All the satellites form a **constellation**.
