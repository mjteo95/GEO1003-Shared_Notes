## 6 - Conclusion

Breakdown of the key conclusions from Chapter 6, organised by topic:

### PPP-RTK

*   **PPP-RTK is a promising technology for mass-market applications because it overcomes the limitations of traditional RTK and PPP.** It combines the strengths of both technologies: the high accuracy of RTK with the wide coverage and fast convergence times of PPP.  However, user adoption is currently slow due to the technology being in its early stages of development and deployment.
*   **Wider industry adoption of PPP-RTK is expected once its benefits and reliability are proven to users.**  Pricing plans and service performance will be key factors in driving this adoption. However,  **PPP-RTK is not expected to fully replace PPP or RTK services soon**. This is due to several factors: user reluctance to switch from familiar technologies, the higher cost of PPP-RTK subscriptions, and the lack of position integrity, which makes it unsuitable as a standalone solution for safety-critical applications. 

### Galileo HAS 

*   **Galileo HAS is predicted to significantly disrupt the high-accuracy positioning market by competing directly with commercial PPP solutions.** As a free and open service, Galileo HAS is expected to displace many commercial offerings, especially if it can deliver comparable performance. 

### Mass-Market Adoption

*   **Improvements in mass-market antenna technology are anticipated to enable wider use of high-accuracy positioning in the near future.** This development will benefit a range of applications, including autonomous navigation (in vehicles, robots, drones, rail, and potentially aerospace), augmented reality, and sports tracking.

### European Market

*   **The European high-accuracy signal augmentation market is well-developed and considered a leader in the industry.** Factors contributing to this include a well-established CORS network, advanced technologies, strong industry leadership, and highly developed service providers.  While the emergence of PPP-RTK may not cause major short-term disruption, **the introduction of Galileo HAS is expected to have a significant impact**. Commercial service providers may need to adapt by specialising in niche applications or offering additional functionality to remain competitive. 

### Standardisation

*   **The lack of standardised SSR data formats presents a challenge to the industry.** Delays in the standardisation process are primarily attributed to conflicting interests among corporate members of the RTCM working group.  Experts suggest an independent advisory group to help progress standardisation. Despite these challenges, **the drive for a globally standardised solution remains strong, especially from automotive manufacturers who see it as a key requirement for implementing high-accuracy positioning data**.
