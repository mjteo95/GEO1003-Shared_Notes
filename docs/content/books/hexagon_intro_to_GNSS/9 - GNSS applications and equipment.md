## 9 - GNSS applications and equipment

> pages 83-98 of Hexagon intro to GNSS

GNSS technologies have revolutionized the way businesses and governments operate, 
this chapter highlight _some_ of the ways they have.

### 9.1 - Consumer
GNSS receivers are now common in consumer hardware like phones, mostly for routing (like Goole Maps)
### 9.2 - Transportation
In rail transportation GNSS is used to keep track of al trains and monitor them form a control room.
In aviation GNSS is used for routing and to make sure planes don't collide midair.
these same patterns of monitoring and routing hold for shipping, driving, biking etc.

Other uses include (semi)autonomous driving or parking and. A special case mentioned is that of
snowplows using PPP positioning to plow roads covered in so much snow the driver cant even see where they are.

### 9.3 - Machine control
GNSS technology is being integrated into
equipment such as bulldozers, excavators,
graders, pavers and farm machinery to
enhance productivity in the real-time
operation of this equipment, and to provide
situational awareness information to the
equipment operator.

The book lists these benefits:

- EFFICIENCY:
By helping the equipment operator get
to the desired grade more quickly, GNSS
helps speed up the work, reducing capital
and operating costs.
- ACCURACY:
The precision achievable by GNSS-based
solutions minimises the need to stop work
while a survey crew measures the grade.
- JOB MANAGEMENT:
Managers and contractors have access
to accurate information about the job
site, and the information can be viewed
remotely.
- DATA MANAGEMENT:
Users can print out status reports, save
important data and transfer files to head
office.
- THEFT DETECTION:
GNSS allows users to define a “virtual
fence” around their equipment and
property for the purpose of automatically
raising an alarm when equipment is
removed, then providing equipment
tracking information to the authorities.

GNSS technologies are now very common on farming equipment because these precise systems require less labour and run 24/7.
GNSS technology are also common in construction and surface mining for the same reasons.

### 9.4 - Survey
GNSS surveying is much quicker than traditional surveying. Using GNSS, it is
possible for a single surveyor to accomplish
in one day what might have taken a survey
crew of three people a week to complete

### 9.5 - Aerial photogrammetry
Using GNSS and INS areal photos can be located and used for things Google Earth or mapping wildfires.

### 9.6 - Ground mapping
Infrastructure visualisation
Using a LiDAR combined with a GNSS+INS,
a user can capture comprehensive visual
information of key infrastructure, such as
oil and gas pipelines.

### 9.7 - Timing
As we mentioned in earlier chapters,
time accuracy is critical for GNSS position
determination. This is why GNSS satellites
are equipped with atomic clocks that
are accurate to nanoseconds. As part of the
position determining process, the local time
of GNSS receivers becomes synchronised
with the very accurate satellite time

### 9.8 - Defence
The defence sector makes broad use of
GNSS technology, including:
- NAVIGATION:
Using GNSS receivers, soldiers and pilots
can navigate unfamiliar terrain or conduct
night-time operations. Most foot soldiers
now carry hand-held GNSS receivers.
- SEARCH AND RESCUE:
If a plane crashes and has a search and
rescue beacon equipped with a GNSS
receiver, it can be located more quickly.
- RECONNAISSANCE AND MAP CREATION:
The military uses GNSS to create maps of
uncharted or enemy territory. They can also
mark reconnaissance points using GNSS.
- UNMANNED VEHICLES:
Unmanned vehicles are used extensively
in military applications, including
reconnaissance, logistics, target and
decoy, mine detection, search and rescue,
research and development and missions
in unsecured or contaminated areas.
- MUNITIONS GUIDANCE:
Precision munitions use GNSS to ensure
they land on target.
